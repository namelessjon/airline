"""
Lightweight wide event logging to bring more observability to lambda functions.

The idea is to build up the full context of a function/script into one wide
event that gets emitted at the end.  This puts all the context in one log
message, making it very easy to run analytics on, find like errors, and a lot
of other things.  A full blown observability platform like honeycomb would be
more informative, and allows for the notion of spans and distributed tracing
(i.e. across different (micro) services and the like).

But this is a start.
